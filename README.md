## monkey.py

Naive infinite monkey implementation. Maximizes on cardinality of common substrings - don't know how good this is, it certainly won't achieve the target.

## monkey_hill_climbing.py

Infinite monkey with incremental improvement, mutates one non-correct character per iteration. Maximizes on correct chars in correct position.
