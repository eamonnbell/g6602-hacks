## turtle_times.py

Usage:

python turtle_times.py somefile

Where somefile is a textfile containing the body text of some news story. Watch as Frank turtle "interprets" the news. See code for implementation comments.

## monkey.py

Naive infinite monkey implementation. Maximizes on cardinality of common substrings - don't know how good this is, it certainly won't achieve the target.

## monkey_hill_climbing.py

Infinite monkey with incremental improvement, mutates one non-correct character per iteration. Maximizes on correct chars in correct position.

(Python 3)

## aftersol.py

After Sol Lewitt. Uses TkInter which is a standard module to draw on a canvas. Would like to expand this to include user input "ratifying" mutations.
